# milobahgProxy
Apache reverse proxy image, running both HTTP and HTTPS
Replace 'key.key' and 'cert.crt' with your SSL cert and key, if you have a chain.crt then add as 'chain.crt' and uncomment in Dockerfile, and in proxy-ssl.conf then rebuild for a new image.


To run as a standalone container:

docker run --name proxy \
-d \
-p 8443:443 \
-p 8080:80 \
-e PROXY_PASS_HTTP='http://httpUrlHere.com/' \
-e PROXY_PASS_SSL='https://httpsUrlHere.com/' \
milobahg/proxy:latest

To run as a service:

docker service create --name proxy \
--publish 8443:443 \
--publish 8080:80 \
-e PROXY_PASS_HTTP='http://httpUrlHere.com/' \
-e PROXY_PASS_SSL='https://httpsUrlHere.com/' \
